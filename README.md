# Portfolio_OPTIMISATION

Portfolio optimization is a critical process in the field of finance with the primary goal of maximizing returns while effectively managing risk. Over time, traditional methodologies have formed the foundation of this process. Models such as Z-scores, Markowitz portfolio optimization, and Johansen cointegration tests have contributed strategies that minimize risk while yielding optimal returns.
This paper introduces an innovative approach that merges the principles of conventional portfolio optimization with the capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The core objective is to identify the most efficient allocation of assets in a portfolio by harnessing the strengths of both methodologies. The study commences by applying classical portfolio optimization techniques to establish a baseline portfolio.
The results of this study highlight how LSTM models are capable of adapting to changing market dynamics, much like their traditional counterparts. These models provide insights into the ideal weightings for different stocks, offering a pathway to achieve the desired financial outcomes. This approach represents a significant step forward in portfolio optimization, as it combines the stability of traditional methods with the adaptability and predictive power of deep learning through LSTM networks.
